## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Seamless Transformation:** A unique mechanical design allows the robot to transition fluidly between its walking and rolling modes.
* **Dual Locomotion:**
    * **Hexapod Mode:** Provides stability and maneuverability for navigating rough, uneven, or cluttered terrain.
    * **Spherical Mode (Rolling):** Enables high-speed, energy-efficient movement across flat, smooth surfaces.
* **Modular CAD:** All design files are provided to allow for easy fabrication using 3D printing.
* **(Placeholder: Specify Control System):** Controlled by a (e.g., Raspberry Pi/Arduino Mega) for complex gait planning and transformation kinematics.
